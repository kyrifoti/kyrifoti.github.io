But people are wrong. Depression is the constant feeling of being numb. Being numb to emotions, being numb to life. You wake up in the morning just to go back to bed again. Days aren't really days, they are just annoying obstacles that need to be faced. When you're depressed, you grasp on to anything that can get you through the day. Even in a strange way you fall in love with your depression because you think it's all you have. It's not being able to see a way out, to see something good, to feel normal. That's what depression is, not sadness or tears, it's the overwhelming sense of numbness and the desire for anything that can help you make it from one day to the next. Please don't suffer in silence and alone.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Ruby wax</strong></div>

                <blockquote><p> </p><p><strong>How fun and friends can help us positively improve all our mental health</strong></p><p>So, in some ways, this is going to be rather different from the norm for me, but the point is that Mental Health is vitally important for us all. I shall be taking you through feeling a fraud, a conversation with my brother, getting damaged and the wider impact that had, going skiing and getting better. Come with me on a little journey…
</p><p>Now, I am not sure who is reading this, so you may not know me. In work, there are some who think I always wear a 3-piece suit, with fob watch, and spend my days presenting. My presentations are always high-energy, including plenty of elements designed to be fun and surprising. In my material, I work in LEGO, Superheroes, my family, Minions, dogs and more. I love presenting, and I am told that comes across loud and clear, and that very public version of myself might not be one you would immediately connect with Mental Health challenges. But here I am, and I offered to do this after being inspired by Kerri’s bravery when she presented at the Systems Swagger event last year. 
</p><p>After my initial offer, I have taken a while to do this. You see, I have never been in the position of being diagnosed with something like Depression or similar. So, I wondered, do I “qualify” to discuss this subject, or am I some kind of fraud to suggest I have something to say? But then, I had a chat with my brother as I drove him down to Heathrow to fly back to his family in Tanzania. He made the point that, when we think about what Mental Health means, we default to thinking about negative things like Depression. While, if I ask you to think about something like Men’s (or Women’s) Health, magazines like those I link to there are intended to encourage a positive direction and how to get ever healthier. So, I started off thinking that I was being rather a fraud to tell my Mental Health story, but I can put my hand on my heart and say that I have been in a place where my health was poor, both mentally and physically. Neither were serious, but both were real and needed work to address. And now I am better, but in both senses of health, that journey is lifelong. So, I consciously need to keep working on both, maintaining or improving my health as needed.
</p><p>Let me take you back a bit. I won’t go all the way back here, just working with some critical elements in my story in the last few years. So, back in 2012, a couple of gentlemen retired from IBM. I knew one of them, and so I threw my hat into the ring to take over his role. This was firmly against his advice, as one of the reasons he was retiring was that he no longer enjoyed his job. But, I had a plan about how I would do the role differently. I felt good enough, strong enough, to believe I could make a go of that. Then, I watched a presentation by the boss of the gentlemen who were leaving, stating that there would not be just one set of shoes to fill, but two, but only one head count slot to cover both. And that whoever took this on would need to be “some kind of Superman”, complete with a picture of the Man of Steel himself! “Oh dear” I thought, or maybe some other words from the commonly used Glaswegian vocabulary. But, I had started, and so, I carried on. It was more than a little scary, but, I thought, as I can’t possibly do all that both those highly experienced individuals did before, I shall stick with my plan and reinvent the role to fit my strengths. I believed I could do this, and as I write this in 2018, it seems I was up to the task.
</p><p>Then, in 2013, we had some serious Resource Actions in IBM Systems, of the kind we had not seen before. Other areas of IBM had been through that sort of thing many times, but it was something new to our part of IBM. It was a rough time, with everyone getting down as friends left and uncertainty reigned. A friend of mine and I had a conversation with one executive, who assured us he had made his decision to stay, but then jumped ship a short time later. Not good for any of us, and, still new in my role, I felt far less comfortable and confident than I had. I survived, but I did not feel good.
</p><p>Along comes 2014, with highs and lows. One thing that happened that year was that we launched our range of IBM Power Systems based on the POWER8 processor. Don’t worry, while I have talked for literally hours about those, I won’t be doing that here! Bringing out POWER8 had me on stage, leading the launch of a range of products that needed us to rethink much of how we (IBM and IBM Business Partners) took these products to market. I built my own material, largely from scratch, and performed! As I mentioned, I love presenting, getting a real buzz out of it. At the same time, afterward, I generally need a bit of “me” time, as it does take a lot out of me. When I first did those new presentations, before we had a more official education session from the IBM European team, it was a challenge. I had never done a launch like that before, and I sure was nervous. But, a big, rugby playing Sales Manager, who I had a lot of time for, told me afterwards that he considered my presentation the best I had ever done. So, I felt great, and ready to take this challenge forward.  At the European education session, my boss spoke to us and talked about rebooting the IBM Power brand, both from where we were in the market, and the aftermath of the year before. I really appreciated that, and we had fun that evening as a team, both IBMers and Business Partners. Clothes pegs and a Chinese meal were involved, but if you weren’t there, explaining that silliness will be rather hard. So, I shall leave it as we had our team, and I felt good again.
</p><p>Later that year, we had another launch, of the bigger servers. I should have been there, but more serious events were taking place. My nephew, Rohan, had been battling a terrible condition called MILAS for a number of years, having been diagnosed in March 2013. MItochondrial encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MILAS) is where the batteries of the body, the mitochondria, don’t work as they should. Rohan’s body could not make the energy the rest of us take for granted. The Lactic Acidosis is something like the pain we can feel when we really push our muscles, the burn that builds up if we run a challenging race or similar. Rohan suffered that pain just as part of normal living. The lack of energy impacted his brain, where, starved of the energy his body could not produce, he suffered a number of what appear like strokes. These robbed him of his sight, damaged his ability to talk and further impacted his muscle control. His mother was remarkable, fighting first to get this rare condition diagnosed, then on to do everything she could for her son. Rohan’s Mother and Father had separated before the diagnosis, but did their best for their son despite the separation. And Rohan’s stepfather went into this situation with his eyes open, knowing what would happen, but doing it anyway. To me, they are heroes, as I have no idea if I could make it if I were in their shoes. MILAS is a genetic condition, which is degenerative, incurable and ultimately, fatal. Rohan lost his fight on the 4th of October 2014, at the age of 10 years young. My boss and my friend helped by covering the work of the launch, so my focus could be on my family, as it needed to be. I am very grateful that they took the work away from me with no fuss at all at that tragic time.
</p><p>Afterwards, I was frankly conflicted. We all mourned Rohan, and celebrated his inspirational courage. The smile he maintained during his fight was heart-warming and remarkable, right to the end. Understandably, many wished he was still with us. I looked at the situation a little differently, in that the brave wee man had suffered so much, and now was at peace. Grief takes us all in different ways, and this feeling of near relief that he would feel no more pain also had me feeling guilty to even think such a thing. A tragic time, obviously, and clearly all the more so for Rohan’s immediate family. He was buried in a LEGO-like coffin, and many wore LEGO items at the funeral. Rohan loved LEGO. I have something of a work brand, where I am known of using LEGO when I talk about our products. I therefore wear the LEGO bricks in the form of cufflinks and also a tie pin, as part that work image. But, I wear them for Rohan too, choosing red LEGO bricks as red was his favourite colour. As you would expect, something this big and serious obviously had us all feeling low, and it takes quite some time to get back to any kind of mental normal after something as big as such a young and tragic death.
</p><p>Next, although this feels insignificant to mention after discussing Rohan’s situation, I damaged my knee. I have been doing karate for a number of years now, and while I remain rather rubbish at it, the focus on keeping fit followed by knowing how to defend myself has worked well for me. One of the main reasons to take up karate was to improve my physical fitness, which had dropped to quite the low point, as comes to us all unless we work on it! We were doing some kicks which involved quite a lot of twisting around, which I was probably not doing quite right. My middle daughter was watching us, as she had done her training earlier and was waiting for my session to finish so I could take us both home. One minute I was trying to get my Roundhouse kick to the right height, the next there was a “pop” and I find myself on the floor with a distinctly painful knee. My daughter watched this happen, and ran over as I suddenly reduced to moaning on the floor. Ice packs were applied, but something had gone wrong and I could not carry on. Driving home was a challenge, but we made it. The medical advice was to go get some physiotherapy, which I did, but juggling schedules meant I saw different physiotherapists each time, and never really got a clear picture of what went wrong. 
</p><p>So, I come into 2015 in, frankly, something of a bad way. There is the visible, annoying, but actually relatively minor issue of my knee. So, I am limping around, and everyone can see that. The knee hurt, but was mostly just a fairly dull ache, unless I twisted it. I could cope with that, but it was just another factor that contributed to my mental state being rather a larger problem. When I get down, I withdraw, so I became rather monosyllabic at home. My wife was probably more deeply impacted by Rohan’s death than I was. It was her sister who had suffered such a loss, and she would regularly be in tears. Perfectly understandable, of course, and only time can help that. She was also trying to get back to work after 10 years out, having been made redundant when our first child was on the way. Despite having 10 years of work experience before that and then considerable voluntary work after that, getting back to work was really hard. I am sure many reading this will have experienced something similar, but I’ll leave that for a different post another time!
</p><p>As I became more monosyllabic, and Clare had her own issues, our relationship was impacted. We did our best for each other, but neither of us were mentally in a good way, which made it hard. At work, I often find the beginning of the year hard. We all work extra hard and many are particularly busy in the push to make the numbers at the end of the year. Business pressures in my role mean I can’t take time off over the Christmas period, which I understand, but it does detract from that otherwise enjoyable time. Obviously, this was also the first Christmas without Rohan, with his death still fresh and raw for us all. Then, we begin the year, and the pressure comes off, which it has to at some point. But, I find that knowing I am adding value greatly helps my self-esteem. Take that pressure away, and have me not running around adding value for a while, and I get rather too much time to think. My thoughts went to all that was not great, both about work, my relationships, my knee, and I was not feeling good at all.
</p><p>So, what changed? Friends, time and focusing on the positive is how I would sum it up. I told my good friend, the one who had helped me out with work when Rohan died, how I was feeling. She did not “fix me”, as only I could do that. But she did not placate or ignore either. She just told me to go do what I enjoy, go have some fun. And, around the same time, another good friend of mine was looking for someone to go skiing with. This friend, Martin, had been a good mate since my school days, and we get on really well. So, the plan was made to go skiing, but I was still really worried about it. I had not been on the slopes for years, and would I be able to do it with my dodgy knee? Well, to cut to the chase, yes, it turns out I could enjoy it immensely! We had a wonderful time, with loads of skiing (with my knee braced, but thankfully giving me minimal issues), liberal amounts of beer, and lots of time to talk. Martin works as a Doctor, so has plenty of his own pressures, but they are different from my own. So, as we sat on the chairlifts we talked. And as we had our beers, before calling the nice man from the chalet to take us back in time for dinner, we talked. We were only away for a few days, but I came back feeling worlds better. We have subsequently kept up the skiing, squeezing in a break that is just the two of us for the past three years. I look forward to that time immensely, and it does me such good each time. My wife is happy for me to go, as the version that comes back is always better company than before!
</p><p>My wife is also doing extremely well. She got back into work, lower down than she deserved, but in just a few years she has climbed the ranks in the way she deserves to do. Her experience and skills are shining through, and her self-confidence is therefore so much better than before. As I am now feeling so much better, and talking more to her, we are back to doing so much better between us too. 
</p><p>Other friends have also been an enormous help, as three of us got together at work and began sending out emails with positive messages in them, weekly and then daily at the busiest time of the year. We have all had and continue to have our challenges, both at home and at work. Focusing on the positive has been a tremendous help to us all. We don’t manage it all the time, but my thinking these days, as I do the house work and similar, is usually on a much more positive area than before.
</p><p>So, I have been unhealthy, and now I am much healthier. There is my knee, and although I still don’t really know what I did to it and therefore I could end up damaging it again, I can now run a 10km race dressed as Wonder Woman (yes, I really did that!) and I can go skiing. But more importantly, I have been down, and in an unhealthy place mentally. Talking, and taking help from my friends has enabled my mental health to be greatly improved. We all need to work on both our physical and mental fitness. Either can become unhealthy, and that is true for us all. But we can improve both, working towards a positive position that does not need to be superhuman. Perfect is impossible, but happy is reachable for us all. We just need to work on it, together.

I went from being in hospital a minimum of three times a week to once every three months and it was hard !</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">As time went on my feelings and thoughts got worse, but I had my son in July 2010 so that took my mind off things for a bit, but it was still there, somehow, I managed to get through my days (looking back I don't know how) looking after 3 children and a husband but still I felt so empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Not wanting to admit defeat I let this go on for 5 years until one day everything just crumbled around me !</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">That's when I thought I can't do this anymore.  Inside I was destroyed but on the outside to most people I looked a picture of health and happiness....and that is the trouble with this invisible illness we call mental health.  With a trip to the doctors I was referred for counselling.  I had to wait but I received weekly phone calls which helped massively until I could be put on an 8-week course.  I suffer with anxiety every day but with the help and guidance I received I have learnt to manage it very well. It will always be there and you have good and bad days but the good now outweighs the bad, instead of the other way around.</span></p><p><strong>Non-IBM</strong></p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p><strong>Never Forget Yourself</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Working in IT we are all very used to documentation for the many products and solutions that we get involved with.  From Tech Web sites through to RedBooks, there is always a manual, so that when things go wrong we should all know what to do to fix it and where to get help along the way.  What we don't have though is that luxury and a RedBook or a manual around life, the pressures that we face, encountering situations and how to deal with them and if possible avoid them reoccurring.  Basically an "Idiots guide to life in general".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">As a people manager one of the key elements of the job is to help and coach people how to overcome challenges they face in work and being there as the support mechanism for the guys in the team to turn to when they need help.  It's actually a really good part of the job to be honest, especially when you see people progressing and realising their potential and a whole lot more.  Being a manager is not all about the technical side of the role it is also looking, listening, learning from and with your team, especially around their well-being and understanding the challenges they are facing etc.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">But as a manager very often the one person you don't manage, is actually the key to any success you may attain, and that is yourself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">I am very lucky, I am part of a very close family.  Since I can remember (which is quite a few years - hence the grey hair and beard), my family has always been there for me and me for them.  From family crisis - "oops she's pregnant" - through to helping with money and basically being the insurance policy in case of issues.  Yes I am a lucky B* &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">A few years back though I encountered a few issues within my family that basically hit me fair and square in the areas that make men cry with pain.  Mom and Dad were getting on in years, health was deteriorating for Mom but Dad was coping looking after her and the rest of us kids were doing our bit, sharing out the duties as best we could to support everything and everyone.  Then all of a sudden, "our kid" got the news that basically no one ever wants, his cancer had returned and this time it was very serious as it was more than likely terminal.  How the hell does anyone cope with that, how the hell do your close relatives deal with it, what will happen, when will it happen, what are the implications etc etc etc. More questions than a box set of Question Time and with the same outcome of no clear answers and a lot of head shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">How did I cope with all of this? Simply put I didn't.  I tried to do everything and anything.  I had no idea who to ask, because there were no pointers or instructions on all of this.  And so began a long slow spiral basically downwards.  Work became a chore, other peoples issues were either far too trivial or far too difficult.  I can now look back and see that depression and all the associated issues was growing, mentally I was becoming a bit of a mess.  My big brother shouldn't be facing this, my parents already struggling shouldn't be facing this, my sister a doctor by trade and unable to cure this shouldn't be facing this. At work the people in the team were not getting the support they needed and deserved because basically I was all over the place.  I looked on the internet, worst thing I could have done.  Advice and diagnosis basically scared the brown stuff out of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Then came the turning point for me, and it came from a resource we have in IBM.  We have a free, confidential service that anyone and everyone can use for all areas around mental issues people are facing.  Initially I was sceptical but during a particular down day, I thought what the hell and gave them a call.  After going through a screening call, which was easy and simple, I was put in touch with someone who was there for me to chat further.  We arranged a face-2-face and off I went to a leafy suburb of Sheffield (OK I am embellishing that bit because anyone who knows Sheffield will know leafy it aint).  I was Mr Sceptical as I walked in, and sat down on a comfy chair to talk with this 'bloke'.  How the conversation started I have not got a clue to be honest because what he did was just chat with me about anything and everything.  Looking back now though you can see it was a mechanism for me to basically open up and realise what the problems were and how I can deal with them.  The hour I spent was one of the most tiring things I have done - and I have triplet granddaughters who I have to play with - I came away with tears having flowed but a massive release of the pressure that had built up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">What the session and the follow-up ones did show me was that in order for me to be effective, I had to look after myself.  I couldn't fix every problem, I couldn't make impossible things possible, but what I could do was to identify things I could influence and by looking after myself I was better able to help others. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Mental Health issues in my experience are not an exact science, it's not one thing, its many aspects.  Learning from my own experiences I can now look back and see the issues I was facing and how I could deal with them.  At work and in life in general, I like to think that now when I see the signs I can help and advise. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">My Mom died last year and my brother a few weeks ago.  The pain I felt and still feel is enormous and probably will take a long time to diminish, but having gone through what I did before I am now able to cope a lot better than I possibly could have done previously.  I know that the guys are there to support me and help if I need them, which a great comfort all around.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">So bottom line here is, don't be afraid to ask for help, it is out there and available for you.  It's not a weakness to ask for help it's a strength.  At the end of the day mental health is like any other sort of health issue, sometimes you need things and people to make it better.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Ian Sanders - IBM</strong></p></blockquote>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                <blockquote><p><strong>Me and PTSD</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">On July the 8th 2013 my mother (Jean) past away at the age of 69, following a short battle with Pancreatic Cancer.  From the time of her diagnose she survived only 7 weeks, dying just 8 weeks before the birth of her 2nd grandchild, my daughter Isa-Jean.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Knowing that my mother would never meet Isa-Jean I recall taking my mother out of hospital to the 4D scanning unit in Solihull.  I did this as I wanted my mother to see what my daughter would look like. My heart torn and broken knowing she would never hold her, witness her get married or be there for any stage of her life.  In addition, Oliver, my son was also on the cusp of starting his first school.  Again, we knew mother would never witness this very special day, so we dressed Oliver in his new uniform and took him to Warwick hospital.  I remember as clear as the sky is on a beautiful sunny day how he looked when he was perched upon his grandmother’s lap holding her frail hand and kissing her cheek.  We took photos, hugged and enjoyed just for a moment some normality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">The night before my mother passed away the doctor approached me and my brother and told us there was nothing more they could do for mum and that she was to be placed on palliative care.  When the doctor told mom what was happening he asked her how she felt, she said “I just want to go back home now”.  I knew my time left with mom was only a matter of hours.  That night I sat on a chair next to her bed holding her hand and stoking her head.  I’d had 7 weeks to prepare myself for her passing, I had convinced myself that I was ready for her final moments, inside I felt stronger than I had envisaged I would be.  This delusion was alas short lived.  You see the picture I had in my mind was the one we see on TV, when we see the actor/actress just fall asleep peacefully.  To my shock and horror when the moment of her passing arrived it was nothing like on TV.  I had duped myself into a false sense of security, those last moments were horrific for me, leaving me traumatized and in a state of shock. The combination of losing the one you love and the post events of my daughter being born and my mother missing my sons 1st day at school coupled with pure heartbreak and grief, I found myself 6 months later being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  Simply put I could not get over the events 6 months prior.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">So how did I know I was mentally ill? The simple answer is, I didn’t !</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">If what I am about to tell you helps you identify with a symptom(s) that you may be suffering from or may in the future, I will gain comfort that my mother’s death was not in vein and that if this case study helps just one person, then I will draw comfort from knowing this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">My symptoms started 3 months after my mother died.  I felt really angry (all the time), every part of my body was filled with rage.  Sometimes I found that getting into road rage incident would provide momentary relief (I admit I am not proud of this).  The stealth anger as I call it was then turned in the direction of my wife and children.  I am not embarrassed to admit (as I was mentally ill at the time) that if I had not had a 1-month old baby I know my wife would have left me for my actions. Next came the ringing in the ears, it was like the noise you hear on TV when they advertise tinnitus, loud environments disorientated me and stressed me very much. Soon after every time I went to bed my heart would be racing, I recall my resting heart rate frequently being 140.  To help with this, they gave me propranolol (heart regulators), but yet still no diagnosis, well they said I was stressed, probably ! “Maybe we should do some heart tests on you” they said.  At this point in time I was hardly sleeping and lay in bed most nights jumping in and out of sleep, this is called Nocturnal Panic Attacks.  Did I know this ? No ! I just thought there was something wrong with me, but I thought it would pass.  6 months in was the absolute catalyst to eventually someone recognising that I had PTSD. I started to get this churning feeling in my stomach, like the feeling you get when you go over a hump back bridge in a car, my daughter calls it a fizzy tummy.  After weeks this feeling was akin to a washing machine running 24x7 it was an indescribable feeling.  The tipping point came on December 30th 2013.  I sat at my desk in IBM Warwick, I was disorientated, focusing on a task took all my effort, my heart was racing, my stomach churning, my ears ringing and then this indescribably need to leave the building and go home consumed me.   I was shaking, but trying to hide if from my peers, I was perplexed as to what was wrong with me.  In short, unbeknown to me I had entered into what they called ‘permanent state anxiety’, a symptom of PTSD.  As it was year-end I pressed on, I was not aware that I was just adding to my condition with stress on top.  As I put closing the year off above my own health.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Eventually I was lucky enough to find a Dr who knew what they were talking about. Thankfully this Dr was able to diagnose me with PTSD.  She explained then when my mother died, for my body to cope with the stress it produces large amounts of adrenaline, as I started to accept my loss and the grief was lessoning, my body however was still in overtime producing too much adrenaline, which then caused all my symptoms.  The more I became comfortable with my grief the greater the symptoms became, the more anxiety I felt.  Let me tell you something, panic attacks are not always what you see on TV, this being someone breathing into a bag.  They are stealth like symptoms effecting your behaviour and cognitive abilities, they come in many disguises.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">The Dr prescribed an anti-anxiety depressant, which after 2 weeks really helped my symptoms, my Dr also suggested I see a Phycologist who specialises in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and one that also specialise in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Using IBM’s Private Medical Insurance (now Cigna), I went onto the have 6 months of therapy once a week.  The conclusion was within 6 months almost all of my symptoms had gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Sadly, this was not the end of my journey, you see in December 2016 my Sister (Beverley) was diagnosed with Stage 4 Terminal Pancreatic Cancer.  Yes, the same cancer that took my mother’s life 2 ½ years earlier.  I was with my sister when she had her diagnosis and here I was again witnessing someone I love recognise that their life will soon be over.  You see you don’t allow yourself the emotion to feel sorry for yourself as you think how can I feel bad about this, I am not the one that is going to die.  The trouble is when the person you love leaves this world you are left with the grief, guilt and stress.  From December 2016 to June 11th 2017 I watched my sister fade away, I have carried her coffin and watched my aged farther fall apart and witness my 2 children who adored their aunty suffer the symptoms of grief.  So again here I am carrying all this stress and grief.  The difference this time is I know the path to walk and this time before any symptoms have arrived I called Cigna Health and self-referred myself.  Currently I am on a new course of CBT (it’s great to talk), I also went to my doctor 7 weeks before my sister passed away to go back on medications.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">So far in this new journey I doing OK, but I take nothing for granted and do everything I can in order to avoid the dark place I once found myself.  I look at it like this, it’s like putting on a seat belt.  You probably won’t have an accident, but if you do your chances of survival are far greater than if you don’t.  So I have put on my belt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Mental health is not something we should be embarrassed about; it is best to talk.  I know I am not judged by anyone, if anything being open about having mental health problems has allowed me to find out that many of my friends also suffer in one way or another, some more than others, some less.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">I was asked if I wanted to write this anonymously.  I am not ashamed, who has the right to judge me ? Who would even question me given what I have been through ? If anything I know my mother and sister would be proud of me trying to help others, I take strength from this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Don’t let your thoughts be your enemy, as my psychologist once told me ‘Thoughts are not facts’.</span></p><p><strong>Simon Williams - IBM</strong></p></blockquote>

I am lucky enough not to have experienced the issues described but what it brought home to me is you never know what is around the corner.  You always assume you will be able to cope and maybe you think you are coping when you are not.  This article will enable me to identify some of the signs, if and when they occur, in both myself and my loved ones. It is ok to ask for help.

              <p class="mbr-fonts-style  display-7"><br>"Hey Kerri, your presentation at Systems Swagger was excellent and had everyone thinking and talking about Mental Health which is half of the battle.  The website looks great and the blogs from Ian and Simon help give a real life perspective on things.  The truth is that every single one of us has anxiety, self doubt, stress, worry, guilt and many more thoughts and feelings that leave us a little off our game at times....or worse.<br><br>I have been through this and used the Employee Assistance Programme thanks to Simon Robertson.  Opening up and talking can be difficult in the first instance as we are supposed to be strong and just deal with life, after all "everyone has problems you just have to get on with it" right?  Putting your hand up and asking for help is not a weakness like we have been taught growing up, it's a strength.  We do not have to do things alone, we are all connected and all ready and willing to help each other - we just need to ask.<br>If anybody feels the need to talk I am available.  ST, email, phone, face to face - whatever you need.  If not me then please just speak to someone.  Even if you do not feel you 'need' help still talk to someone, you will be surprised by what you keep locked away deep inside your brain.<br><br>I'm sure there are plenty of analogies about brain processing power, capacity and de-dup but "I'm not technical" so will leave it there"<br></p>
